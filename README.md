# Simple Terminal Calculator README

## Overview
This script offers a terminal-based calculator performing basic arithmetic and checks (prime, odd/even, divisible by five) with colorized output for enhanced readability.

## Features
- Arithmetic Operations: Add, subtract, multiply, divide, exponentiation, modulus.
- Input Validation: Ensures correct input format.
- Checks: Determines if the result is prime, odd/even, and divisible by five.
- Colorized Output: Uses ANSI codes for colored text.

## Usage
1. Ensure Python 3 is installed.
2. Run `python calculator_script.py` in the terminal (replace `calculator_script.py` with your script's filename).
3. Follow the on-screen prompts to choose operations and input numbers.

## Note
If colorization does not work as expected, your terminal might not support ANSI escape codes, or adjustments may be necessary.
